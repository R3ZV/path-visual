          <h2>A*</h2>

          <p>
            A* (pronounced "A-star") is a graph traversal and pathfinding algorithm,
            which is used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness,
            optimality, and optimal efficiency.
          </p>


          <p>
            Given a weighted graph, a source node and a goal node, the algorithm
            finds the shortest path (with respect to the given weights) from source to goal.
          </p>

          <p>
            One major practical drawback is its O(b^d) space complexity, as it stores all
            generated nodes in memory. Thus, in practical travel-routing systems, it is generally outperformed by
            algorithms
            that can pre-process the graph to attain better performance, as well as by memory-bounded approaches;
            however, A* is still the best solution in many cases.

          <h2>BFS</h2>
          <p>
            Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a
            given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to
            the nodes at the next depth level. Extra memory, usually a queue, is needed to keep track of the child nodes
            that were encountered but not yet explored.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, in a chess endgame, a chess engine may build the game tree from the current position by
            applying
            all possible moves and use breadth-first search to find a win position for White. Implicit trees (such as
            game
            trees or other problem-solving trees) may be of infinite size; breadth-first search is guaranteed to find a
            solution node if one exists.

          <h2>Dijkstra</h2>

          <p>
            Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in
            a weighted graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist
            Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.
          </p>

          <p>
            The algorithm exists in many variants. Dijkstra's original algorithm found the shortest path between two
            given
            nodes, but a more common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the
            source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.

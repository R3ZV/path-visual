                    <h3>A*</h3>

                    <p>
                        A* (pronounced "A-star") is a graph traversal and pathfinding algorithm,
                        which is used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness,
                        optimality, and optimal efficiency.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        Given a weighted graph, a source node and a goal node, the algorithm
                        finds the shortest path (with respect to the given weights) from source to goal.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One major practical drawback is its O(b^d) space complexity, as it stores all
                        generated nodes in memory. Thus, in practical travel-routing systems, it is generally
                        outperformed by
                        algorithms
                        that can pre-process the graph to attain better performance, as well as by memory-bounded
                        approaches;
                        however, A* is still the best solution in many cases.

                    <h3>BFS</h3>
                    <p>
                        Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that
                        satisfies a
                        given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to
                        moving on to
                        the nodes at the next depth level. Extra memory, usually a queue, is needed to keep track of the
                        child nodes
                        that were encountered but not yet explored.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For example, in a chess endgame, a chess engine may build the game tree from the current
                        position by
                        applying
                        all possible moves and use breadth-first search to find a win position for White. Implicit trees
                        (such as
                        game
                        trees or other problem-solving trees) may be of infinite size; breadth-first search is
                        guaranteed to find a
                        solution node if one exists.

                    <h3>DFS</h3>

                    <p>
                        Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data
                        structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root
                        node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before
                        backtracking. Extra memory, usually a stack, is needed to keep track of the nodes discovered so
                        far along a specified branch which helps in backtracking of the graph.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A version of depth-first search was investigated in the 19th century by French mathematician
                        Charles Pierre Tr√©maux[1] as a strategy for solving mazes.[2][3]
